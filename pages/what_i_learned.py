# Image Classification
with st.expander("Image Classification"):
    st.write("""
    Image classification is the task of categorizing images into predefined classes or labels. 
    In my project on animals image classification, I learned how to use pre-trained models and image embeddings 
    to classify images of animals into different categories. This helped me understand the concept of 
    feature extraction and how it can be applied in real-world scenarios.

# Sentiment Analysis
with st.expander("Sentiment Analysis"):
    st.write("""
    Sentiment analysis involves analyzing and classifying text data to determine the sentiment expressed, 
    such as positive, negative, or neutral. In my project on the basic sentiment analyzer, 
    I learned how to use NLTK and a Naive Bayes classifier to perform sentiment analysis on text messages. 
    This taught me the importance of text preprocessing and feature engineering in natural language processing tasks.

# Prediction
with st.expander("Prediction"):
    st.write("""
    Prediction involves using machine learning models to make predictions or forecasts based on input data. 
    In my project on the California housing price predictor, I learned how to train a machine learning model 
    to predict the median house value based on various housing features. This taught me how to 
    preprocess data, train a model, and evaluate its performance for prediction tasks.
